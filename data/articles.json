    "summary": "This comprehensive analysis examines the recovery trajectory of North Atlantic cod stocks following decades of overfishing. The research highlights how international quota agreements, gear restrictions, and cooperative management between nations sharing these fisheries have contributed to measurable stock rebounds in several regions. Despite these positive trends, the study cautions that climate change impacts, including warming waters and shifting prey distributions, present ongoing challenges to sustained recovery efforts.",
