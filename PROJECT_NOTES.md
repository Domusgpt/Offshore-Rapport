# Offshore Rapport - Project Notes

## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Content System

The project implements a dynamic content system where:

1. Article data is stored in JSON format in the `data/articles.json` file
2. The `js/data-loader.js` module handles loading and processing this data
3. The `js/article-renderer.js` module creates DOM elements from the data
4. The CSS is structured to support category-specific theming

### Tag Filtering System

The tag filtering functionality:

1. Allows filtering articles by tags
2. Integrates with the existing category filtering
3. Provides a smooth user experience with animations
4. Supports clickable tags in article cards

### Content Management Dashboard

The dashboard:

1. Provides a clean interface for content management
2. Supports creating, editing, and deleting articles
3. Includes JSON preview for added articles
4. Allows importing/exporting article data
5. Manages tags and keywords
